== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Symbiostock completely free or is there a premium version with more features? =

Symbiostock is 100% free! We have decided to release it as a fully featured free version and sustain development through value added services such as our PLUS hosting solutions and premium themes.

= Will Symbiostock conflict with my current WooCommerce integration? =

Symbiostock is not meant to work hand in hand with other digital media downloads. It will work with other physical downloads, but this is not a supported feature as Symbiostock is generally meant to turn your WooCommerce store into a digital media store.

We are deep in the development of a fully functional networking system that will permit Symbiostock users to showcase their images collectively and generate sales.
